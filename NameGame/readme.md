# Name Game

Run the `namegame.py` file to see the rules and play. Ensure the terminal's pwd is the same as the .py file so the `names.txt` file can be read by the script.

## TODO
- add more names for the CPU player
- add support for 2 local players
- adding coloring to the console output
- add support for a timed mode to make it sweaty
