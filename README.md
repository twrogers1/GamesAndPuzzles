# Word Search
Solve a word search using the built-in Python libraries. Pretty print to the terminal.

Currently works in Mac OSX Terminal. For Windows users, the VS Code Terminal also works.
  
# Setup
The script will read from the `intput.txt` file, located in the same directory as the `word_search.py` file. The input file consists of two sections, `:Puzzle:` and `:Word Bank:`

- The :Puzzle: input can include spaces between words, but isn't required
- The :Word Bank: input should be given with each word on a new line

Refer to the `input_sample.txt` file for an example.
