# Word Search
Solve a word search using the built-in Python libraries and pretty print to the terminal.

*Windows users will need to use [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) for proper printing as the output contains unicode characters. VS Codes' terminal also works well.

# Setup
The script will read from the `intput.txt` file, located in the same directory as the `word_search.py` file. The input file consists of two sections, `:Puzzle:` and `:Word Bank:`  

- The :Puzzle: input can include spaces between words, but isn't required
- The :Word Bank: input should be given with each word on a new line

Refer to the `input_sample.txt` file for an example.
